# Computer Vision - Master of Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to the repository for the Computer Vision course, completed as part of the Masterâ€™s program in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bucharest. This repository contains a project focused on automatic score calculation for a game by analyzing images of the game board.

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a computer vision system to automatically calculate scores for a game by interpreting images of the game board. The system uses image processing techniques to analyze board configurations and compute scores based on predefined rules.

### Key Components

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing game board images for analysis. This may include resizing, normalization, and noise reduction.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Methods for identifying and extracting relevant features from the game board images, such as board elements and positions.

3. **Score Calculation**: Algorithms and logic for computing scores based on the extracted features and game rules.
